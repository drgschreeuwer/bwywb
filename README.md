# Be Who You Wanna Be – Tablet Prototype

A clickable prototype for the BWYWB learning platform. Built with **Vite + React + Tailwind** so it opens instantly on StackBlitz.

## One‑click (via GitHub)

1. Create a new empty GitHub repo (no README needed).
2. Upload all files from this folder to the repo (Add file → Upload files → Commit).
3. Open: `https://stackblitz.com/github/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>`

StackBlitz will boot the app automatically.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

---

This project uses no external UI libs, only Tailwind utility classes, so it’s portable and fast.
